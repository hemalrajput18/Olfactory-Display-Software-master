## Effects of Coffee Research
Findings:
* 'researchers split 114 students into two groups to answer maths questions from the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT). One group was exposed to a coffee smell during the test, and ended up with "significantly higher" scores.' - [1]
* 'just smelling the beverage seemed to boost students' expectations for how well they would do.' - [1]
* 'Researchers examined the rats' brains to try to "unravel the molecular effects" of the smell of coffee on the brain. Here's some of what they found:' - [2]
   *The coffee-sniffing sleep-deprived rats showed different levels of activity in 17 genes in the brain.
   *Levels of some brain proteins also changed in ways that could have a calming effect on stress or have antioxidant function.
* 'Impair your objectivity in decision-making. Caffeine triggers the release of adrenaline – a hormone which triggers a fast response. This fight-or-flight mechanism is great if you’re being chased by a bear, but not so great when you’re responding to a curt email from an angry customer. When adrenaline is released, your brain is put into a hyper-aroused state, causing you to circumvent rational thinking in favour of a fast response.' - [3]
